# PatternAutomataCompressor (PAC)

**Lossless compressor based on finding complex data patterns with AI and representing/generating them efficiently using learned automata.**

This repository contains the research and implementation for the PatternAutomataCompressor (PAC), a novel approach to lossless data compression outlined in the Ph.D. research proposal [Link to Proposal/Paper if available, otherwise omit].

## Core Concept

PAC aims to improve compression ratios, particularly for data with complex or non-linear redundancies, by combining modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with classical Automata Theory. The core idea involves a multi-stage process:

1.  **AI-Driven Pattern Detection:** Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering, autoencoders, transformers) to analyze the input data and identify recurring patterns. These patterns might be more sophisticated than simple string repetitions found by traditional methods.
2.  **Automata Learning:** For each significant pattern class identified, learn a compact generative automaton (such as a Finite State Automaton (FSA) or Cellular Automaton (CA)) that can reproduce instances of that pattern, ideally from a minimal initial state.
3.  **Encoding/Decoding:**
    *   **Encoding:** Scan the input data. Replace occurrences of identified patterns with a reference to their corresponding learned automaton and any necessary initial conditions. The remaining data (not part of learned patterns) is encoded literally or using a fallback method.
    *   **Decoding:** Read the encoded stream. When an automaton reference is encountered, execute the automaton to regenerate the original pattern data. Combine this with the literally decoded data to reconstruct the original file.

The primary hypothesis is that for certain data types, the combined size of the automaton definitions and their references will be significantly smaller than storing the raw pattern data repeatedly.

## Project Status

This is currently a **research project** in its early stages, stemming from a Ph.D. proposal.

*   **Conceptual Framework:** Defined.
*   **Implementation:** Under development / planning stages. Key challenges lie in the effective and efficient implementation of the Automata Learning phase.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Develop robust AI pattern detection modules.
    *   Design and implement novel/adapted algorithms for learning generative automata from detected patterns.
    *   Build a functional encoding/decoding framework (PAC).
    *   Theoretically analyze the potential compression bounds and complexity.
    *   Empirically evaluate PAC against standard compression algorithms on diverse datasets.

## Planned Features

*   Modular AI pattern detection pipeline.
*   Implementation of learning algorithms for FSAs and/or CAs tailored to pattern generation.
*   PAC encoder and decoder engine.
*   Command-line interface for compression/decompression.
